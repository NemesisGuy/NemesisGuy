---

Hi — I'm Peter (NemesisGuy). I run NemesisNet from Cape Town: a full‑spectrum engineering practice that builds and operates production-grade web services and self-hosted infrastructure.

What I do:

- Design and implement backend systems with Spring Boot and MySQL
- Build SPAs with Vue.js and modern front-end tooling
- Containerise and deploy with Docker / Docker Compose
- Run a physical home lab (ESXi, hypervisors, networking, monitoring)
- Automate tooling for analytics, uptime, and CI/CD

Featured projects you can check out:

- On The Go Rentals — full-stack car rental app (Spring Boot + Vue.js)
- CodeCritical — Java code analysis and metrics tooling
- Kokoro TTS Service — high-performance TTS API (FastAPI)
- VibeType — voice-driven coding assistant (Whisper + local LLMs)

If you'd like this post adapted for the blog (shorter summary, different title, or images/banners), tell me what to change and I'll update it and push the revision.

— Peter
